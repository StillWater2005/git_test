Hello Odin!
Today I leart a few thing about internet, the five layered protocol stack that is used, how data is transfered being passed from one layer to another, with each layer providing a specified funcationality
to the higher layer, relying on the funcationality of the layer below. The five layer of the TCP/IP protocol are:-
1. Application layer
2. Tranport layer
3. Network layer
4. Data link layer
5. Physical layer
The OSI model, along with these layer, also has 2 extra layer the session layer and the presentation layer, which on the internet is the responsibility of the application layer developer to develop if needed.
